   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-ai-bot.git
   cd reddit-ai-bot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```

## Setup

Before running the bot, ensure you have your Reddit API credentials and Groq API key ready.

- **Reddit API Authentication**:  
   You'll need to provide the following credentials:
    - `client_id`: Your Reddit API client ID
    - `client_secret`: Your Reddit API client secret
    - `user_agent`: A user-agent for your application
    - `username`: Your Reddit username
    - `password`: Your Reddit password

- **Groq API Key**:  
   Obtain a Groq API key from the [Groq API website](https://groq.com).

### Configuration

In the code, the Reddit API and Groq API are authenticated like this:



```python
reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id="your_client_id",         
    client_secret="your_client_secret",
    user_agent="your_user_agent",
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
)

llm = ChatGroq(
    model="llama-3.1-70b-versatile", #use model as per requirement
    temperature=0.5,
    timeout=None,
    max_retries=2,
    api_key="your_groq_api_key" #create your own API Key
)
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Usage

### Running the Bot

Run the script to start the bot. The bot will automatically post content to Reddit and comment on posts at scheduled times.

```bash
python reddit_ai_bot.py
```

- The bot will post content at **9:43 PM** daily.
- The bot will comment on a post at **9:44 PM** daily.

You can modify the schedule as needed by changing the times in the code.

## Logging

The bot uses the `logging` library to log errors. You can find logs in the terminal, or you can modify the code to save logs to a file.
